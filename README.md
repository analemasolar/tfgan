# TFGan
This repository shows the three jupyter notebooks that have been used to train the neural networks exposed in the TFG of Manuel Nevado Fabián.

## Content of the Notebooks
   ### CycleGanMem
 This is the notebook in which the CycleGAN network has been experimented.
   ### TFGan_UpSampler
 Is the notebook for experimenting with the TFGAN-UP architecture.
   ### TFGan_UpSampler
 It is the training notebook of the standard TFGAN. It is the most important one. In this notebook both the standard TFGAN and the TFGANUP have been trained.




 The training of these networks is done with the UTK faces database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new) reconstructed with the pipeline explained in the TFG memo associated to this project. Follow the explained steps to execute the code
